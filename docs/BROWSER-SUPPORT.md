**Older Safari uses CSS fallback with padding-top trick

## 🔧 Fallbacks Included

### Aspect Ratio (for older Safari)
- Modern browsers use `aspect-ratio: 16/10`
- Older browsers use padding-top percentage trick
- Both achieve same visual result

### Drive Preview Issues
- If iframe blocked → "Open in Drive" button works
- If cookies disabled → Direct link fallback
- If page jump fails → Manual navigation in Drive

## 📱 Mobile Considerations

### iOS (iPhone/iPad)
- Tel links open phone app
- Email links open mail app
- Drive files open in Drive app if installed
- Sticky contact bar shows at bottom

### Android
- Same functionality as iOS
- Chrome is primary browser
- Drive integration seamless

1. Open `index.html` in browser
